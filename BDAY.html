                    <p>Paragraph moumitar bday er jonno.
                    Its been a long long time since we last met in person, three years🥺. The last time we were physically present together and 
                    sharing a GOOD laugh was way back in class 10. But believe me Mou, i still feel comfortable talking to you like i always did, 
                    it feels like it hasn't been three long years that i haven't met you. Yes, both of us have different lives now, different 
                    people around us, different priorities and we hardly talk to each other, but whenever we do its wonderful. Guess this is 
                    what real friendship means. Anyways lots of sentimental talks, lets get to the point:
                    Wishing you a Very Very Happy birthday in this Lockdown. This birthday is going to be special (All thanks to Corona😅). 
                    But given its you, you can still enjoy your part in this condition, Moumita can laugh and enjoy in any difficult situation 
                    and that's one very good quality you have. Always keep laughing like this, be happy, stay safe and yes crack Neet, and 
                    i'll be waiting for you to join my college😏.
                    Lots of love and best wishes.
                    From yours Nandu😁

                    <p>Dear Moumita, I know u since 11 yrs , and in this period I have seen u cry , I've seen u  getting angry I've seen u 
		laughing ur ass out in ur lame jokes . Their will be a lot many people who will come into ur life . They will come and go . 
		But the memories with ur childhood buddies will always be remembered. U are my beautiful mistake like . From doing crazy 
		things to clicking those crazy pictures I cherish every moment spend with u... sometimes u act like a child and I have to 
		tolerate that but never mind hota hai. After 40 yrs when u are an old lady with white hairs and wrinkles on ur face sitting 
		on an armchair and telling ur grandchildren about all the stories of mischief that u did that u did in ur preteen yrs, 
		how did u fell in love in ur teens and of course about me. U won't forget me right ?  I know u won't ( Jodi bhule jash 
		barite eshe raid marbo) ..remember those blue house charts ? God u were so lazy back then 🥱. I still remember and occupying 
		the full compartment  with acb girls all around while returning home was the best part of the school memories.....I love u 
		loadss...and miss u idiot happy birthday ...njoy ur day...and this boy took a lot of pain to do this so I thank him instead 
		of writing a whole paragraph in a status which will go away in 24 hrs it's better to keep it here which will stay with u forever .
		Couple of yrs later we will all will stay in  different places occupied with our professions ..not getting time to call or text. 
		But still I wish whenever we meet things won't be awkward between us . No formalities. Our behaviour should make people 
		believe that " ei duto mohila paglachoda ". When u get married I will be the maid of honour. Njoy ur special day with ur family.
		Rather than wishing u happy birthday I will thank aunty for giving birth and raising such a piece of shit . I hate ya  
		and u know my love is  in my hate...be happy always . Never change for anyone all the best for future .❤❤❤❤❤❤❤</p>
